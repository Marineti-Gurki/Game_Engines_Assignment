### The Idea
The main concept of this game is that you are placed in a world with a challenge. The challenge is to survive a horror mini-game, and to find the one lava lamp in the world.

Best experienced with headphones and VR, although some VR controls are semi-broken currently

### How to play

Once game has started, go to the glass object and press F. In VR one of the controller buttons will switch the scene.
This will bring you to the challenge.

### Some notes
The low resolution is by design, and is intended to emulate old console games intended to run on CRT TVs. It also adds to the creepiness of the second scene.
