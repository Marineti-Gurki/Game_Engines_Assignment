# Description of the project
The main concept of this game is that you are placed in a cosmic-like world with a challenge. The challenge is to survive a horror mini-game, and to find the one lava lamp in the world, make sure the snake doesn't catch you. 

Best experienced with headphones and VR, although some VR controls are semi-broken currently.
The low resolution is by design, and is intended to emulate old console games intended to run on CRT TVs. It also adds to the creepiness of the second scene.

# Instructions for use
The game will automatically put you into VR if you have a headset connected. When in the house, walking up to the glass pill on the sloped metal panel and pressing F or one of the gamepad buttons on the left controller will bring you to the second scene. 

# How it works
The game is made in Godot, and uses a large variety of Nodes. The project uses two plugins, one for creating the world environment (HTerrain plugin) in the second scene, and the other for VR functionality(OpenXR Godot plugin).
